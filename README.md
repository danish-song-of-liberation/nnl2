# nnl2
Common Lisp (CL) neural network framework

*About the Author:* This framework is being developed by a 14-year-old (already 15) as a personal solo project. All code, all bugs, all mine!

I write the framework mainly for myself because writing on torch or tensorflow develops into eternal procrastination and unwillingness to write code on it.

Framework has a first version (nnl), you can see it in my repositories.

# Why didn't I decide to finish the first version of NNL?

to be more specific, due to problems with BPTT, recurrent graphs, and poor library selection

# Framework Architecture

The framework is divided into three main components:

1. Tensor System (95% complete)
2. Autodiff System (with 5 different modes)
3. Neural Networks Implementations
