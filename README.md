# nnl2
Common Lisp (CL) neural network library

*About the Author:* This framework is being developed by a 15-year-old as a personal solo project. All code, all bugs, all mine!

I write the framework mainly for myself because writing on torch or tensorflow develops into eternal procrastination and unwillingness to write code on it.

Framework has a first version (nnl), you can see it in my repositories.

# Why didn't I decide to finish the first version of NNL?

to be more specific, due to problems with BPTT, recurrent graphs, and poor library selection

# Framework Architecture

The framework is divided into three main components:

1. Tensor System (100% complete)
2. Autodiff System (with 5 different modes)
3. Neural Networks Implementations

I'm sorry, but I have VERY, VERY little time right now, so the code is writing slowly
